# Unit-5---Financial-Planning
I developed a prototype application that allows people to assess their monthly personal finances, and also be able to forecast a reasonable retirement plan based on cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds.

# Tips: 
- This notebook requires that an API key is need to run the code.
- The stock exchange is closed on weekends (252 trading days in a year).
- Remember to restart kernel incase of "bugs".
- Change settings in MCForecastTools.py from n%10 == to n%100, so less simulations print.
